title: Assignment 2 Released
---

I have just released Assignment 1.  This post explains how to start working on it.

You can read the specification [in the assignments section]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments).

I have also released an intro video on Echo360, accessible through Blackboard
where the lecture recordings are.  The intro explains how to start the
assignment and pass the first test.  Students should follow the intro with their
IDE open, redoing the same steps, before start working on the assignment.
